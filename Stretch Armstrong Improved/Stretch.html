I opened this site for all you stretch nuts out there like myself who are crazy about these highly collectable stretch figures as I am.Of course all the stretch versions will be included here like the Super Holy Grail Denys Fisher Stretch Hulk, Stretch Serpent, The Octopi Siblins, X Ray, Monster, and dont forget the very scarce Mego Elastics! Few poeple realize just how many Stretch Figure versions were actually produced. An estimated&nbsp;67 different versions from Japan, Germany, Italy, France,Australia and other countries all took part in there own versions of the Armstrong and Monster. But Companies such as Hasbro,Justoys and Cap Toys produced their own unique Stretch Figures like Stretch Mask, and the&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;1993 Stretch Armstrong. </font></p><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#993300">I started collecting these awsome stretches&nbsp;10 years ago and now I have the Largest most complete Stretch collection in the world as you will see on this site. Stretch Armstrong figures are highly collectable, very valuable,and unlike any other action figure because they are filled with corn syrup are&nbsp;very unique.I happen to be the utmost authority on Stretch Figure Preservation and have devised several methods of this preservation process I will share with you on Stretch Armstrong World.These 4 easy preservation steps will make it possible to maintain your stretch figure for another 30 years and beyond. </font></p><p><font color="#993300"><font size="5">The original Stretch Armstrong figure idea was concieved by a CPG employee named James O. Kuhn in 1974. Kenner did not actually recieve a patent for the figure untill 1979. From 1976 to 1979 Kenner made over 50 million dollars on all the stretch versions,and was the largest buyer of cornsyrup over those same years .</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">There were 40,000 Stretch Armstrongs produced by Kenner in the U.S. between 1976 and 1979. Thats not really that many if you think about it especially since 99% of them were ripped apart and thrown and never made it past Christmas of 1976. That means out of the over 300 Million people in the U.S. roughly every 7,500 persons would have to share only one Stretch Armstrong figure! There have been only about&nbsp;170 Stretch Armstrongs that have appeared in the last&nbsp;10 years in varying conditions and only about 50 in clean to near mint condition.There are even fewer of the other versions like Stretch Batman or Plasticman of which there are only 1 or 2 left in existence today.Most of the&nbsp;stretch figures you will come to see on ebay and various places are in very bad conditon with leaks,holes&nbsp;and&nbsp;unrepairable damage.&nbsp;Thats gives you an idea of just how rare these stretches have become. Only a handful are left today,only a handful.Stretch Armstrong numbers are still declining each day as their owners dig them out of the atticks and&nbsp;basments&nbsp;after over 35 years only to bend them or stretch them to ruin while learning after just how much their stretch arsmtrong figure&nbsp;was worth.</font></font></p><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#993300">The cornsyrup was condensed to just the right viscosity to make the stretch return slowly to its original position as the latex skin reacted against this highly viscosic goo. Collectors of these figures are very aggresive and determined because they know with such limited numbers remaining that at any time they may be all gone. This can make finding the one you want more difficult yet more fun too. Afterall the fun is always in the hunt, right? It took me&nbsp;4 years to find the Stretch Serpent! One can only know how much fun collecting stretches can be if one becomes as obsessed as I have become.Stretches are in a class all by themselves and their value has remained more stable than Gold making them a truely great investment!&nbsp;</font></p><p><font size="6" color="#ff0000"><font color="#993300">Get ready for a look at Americas favorite then and now action figures. Be very carefull, or you just may become a Stretchy!</font> </font></p><p><font size="5" color="#000000">Your Entrance to My Stretch Kingdom is now Granted, For I am,The Stretch King!
